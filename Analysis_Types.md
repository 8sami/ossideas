## Database Relationships

The `analysis_types` table is related to the `analysis_results` table through the `analysis_type_id` foreign key. Each analysis result is associated with either an idea or a repository:

```
analysis_types (1) --- (*) analysis_results (*) --- (1) ideas
                                  |
                                  |
                                  v
                               repositories
```

This structure allows for flexible analysis generation and storage, with each analysis type having its own specialized output format and purpose.

## Conclusion

The analysis types in the OSSIdeas platform provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating business opportunities from open-source repositories. By using specialized AI agents to generate different types of analyses, the platform can provide users with detailed, actionable business ideas.

The proposed enhancements to the analysis types and AI agents will further improve the quality and comprehensiveness of the generated business ideas, covering all key aspects from initial concept to go-to-market strategy.
