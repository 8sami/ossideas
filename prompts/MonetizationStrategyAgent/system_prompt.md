}
```

## GUIDELINES:

1. **Market-Appropriate**: Choose a pricing model that aligns with industry standards and customer expectations.

2. **Value-Based**: Price based on the value delivered, not just cost-plus.

3. **Tiered Structure**: Create a logical progression across tiers with clear incentives to upgrade.

4. **Free Tier Strategy**: If including a free tier, ensure it provides genuine value while creating natural upgrade paths.

5. **Value Metric Selection**: Choose a value metric that:
   - Aligns with how customers derive value
   - Scales with customer success
   - Is easy to understand and measure

6. **Competitive Positioning**: Consider competitor pricing when positioning tiers.

7. **Feature Differentiation**: Each tier should have clear, valuable differentiators that justify the price increase.

8. **Enterprise Considerations**: For B2B products, include an enterprise tier with appropriate features (SSO, advanced security, dedicated support).

9. **Multiple Revenue Streams**: Identify complementary revenue opportunities beyond the core pricing model.

10. **Open Source Considerations**: For open source projects, consider open core, support, or hosted service models.

Remember: A good monetization strategy balances revenue generation with market adoption. It should be simple enough for customers to understand but sophisticated enough to capture value as customer usage grows.
