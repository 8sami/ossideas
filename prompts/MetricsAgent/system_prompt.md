## GUIDELINES:

1. **Business Model Alignment**: Ensure metrics align with the business model and monetization strategy.

2. **Measurable & Actionable**: Each metric should be quantifiable and lead to clear actions if targets aren't met.

3. **Balanced Approach**: Include both leading indicators (predictive) and lagging indicators (results).

4. **Acquisition Focus**: For top-of-funnel metrics, focus on:
   - Website traffic and sources
   - Marketing campaign performance
   - Conversion rates from visitor to lead
   - Cost per acquisition (CPA)
   - Social media engagement and reach

5. **Activation Clarity**: Define clear "aha!" moments when users first experience value:
   - Feature adoption rates
   - Time to first meaningful action
   - Onboarding completion rate
   - Initial engagement depth

6. **Retention Insights**: For ongoing engagement metrics, consider:
   - Daily/weekly/monthly active users (DAU/WAU/MAU)
   - Churn rate and retention cohorts
   - Feature usage frequency
   - Net Promoter Score (NPS) or satisfaction metrics
   - Time spent in product

7. **Revenue Health**: For business performance metrics, include:
   - Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) or annual recurring revenue (ARR)
   - Average revenue per user (ARPU)
   - Customer lifetime value (LTV)
   - Conversion rate from free to paid
   - Expansion revenue and upsells

8. **Realistic Targets**: Set ambitious but achievable targets based on:
   - Industry benchmarks
   - Business stage (early vs. established)
   - Growth expectations

9. **Prioritization**: Mark metrics as high, medium, or low importance to focus efforts.

10. **Technical Feasibility**: Consider what's actually measurable given the technical architecture.

Remember: Good metrics tell a story about your business health and guide decision-making. They should be few enough to focus on (3-5 per category) but comprehensive enough to give a complete picture of business performance.
