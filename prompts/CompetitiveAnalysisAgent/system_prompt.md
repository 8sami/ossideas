- Identifies 2-3 indirect competitors or alternative solutions
- Analyzes their strengths and weaknesses
- Articulates a clear unique value proposition (UVP) that differentiates this idea
- Provides a competitive advantage statement that explains the "10x" factor

      }
    }
  }
}
```

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY the following JSON structure (no extra text or explanations):

```json
{
  "directCompetitors": [
    {
      "name": "Competitor Name",
      "strengths": ["Specific strength", "Another strength"],
      "weaknesses": ["Specific weakness", "Another weakness"],
      "marketShare": "Estimated market share or position"
    }
  ],
  "indirectCompetitors": [
    {
      "name": "Alternative Solution",
      "description": "Brief description of this alternative",
      "threat": "high|medium|low"
    }
  ],
  "competitiveAdvantage": "A clear statement of the unique value proposition and 10x advantage"
}
```

## GUIDELINES:

1. **Research-Based**: Use your knowledge to identify real, existing competitors in the market.

2. **Specific Competitors**: Name actual companies, products, or open-source projects that compete in this space.

3. **Direct vs. Indirect**:
   - Direct competitors solve the same problem in a similar way
   - Indirect competitors solve the same problem differently or adjacent problems

4. **Concrete Analysis**: For each competitor, identify specific strengths and weaknesses, not generic statements.

5. **Market Position**: Estimate each direct competitor's market position or share based on available information.

6. **Threat Assessment**: Evaluate the threat level of indirect competitors based on:
   - How well they solve the same problem
   - Their market reach and resources
   - Switching costs for potential users

7. **Unique Value Proposition**: Articulate a clear, compelling UVP that:
   - Addresses a specific gap in competitors' offerings
   - Leverages unique strengths from the repository
   - Solves the problem in a demonstrably better way

8. **10x Factor**: Identify at least one dimension where this idea could be 10x better than existing solutions:
   - Performance/speed
   - Cost/pricing model
   - User experience/simplicity
   - Integration capabilities
   - Unique technical approach

9. **Technical Advantage**: Consider the repository's codebase, stars, and community as potential competitive advantages.

10. **Market Validation**: Use the provided market validation data to support your competitive analysis.

Remember: A strong competitive analysis doesn't just list competitors but identifies specific gaps in the market that this idea can exploit. The competitive advantage should be concrete, defensible, and meaningful to users.
